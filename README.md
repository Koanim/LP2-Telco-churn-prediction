# Telco Customer Churn Prediction 
Welcome to our Customer Churn Prediction project, where we use Supervised Machine Learning to analyze customer churn and develop effective retention strategies. Throughout this endeavor, we've followed the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework diligently. Our goal is to predict and address customer churn by carefully examining data variables and implementing a range of techniques.

# Project Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Information about customers' demographics, services, payments, and churn status was gathered from a variety of sources, including CSV/Excel files and SQL Server tables.

- **Data Processing**: Involved utilizing libraries such as pyodbc and pandas to convert collected data into an appropriate format, resulting in the creation of a comprehensive dataset.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Comprehensive EDA was conducted, encompassing tasks such as summarizing data, addressing missing values, and conducting univariate and bivariate analyses. This process utilized libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

-  **Data Preprocessing**: Included cleaning the data, addressing missing values, and transforming categorical variables to prepare it for detailed analysis using pandas.

-  **Hypothesis Testing**: Various statistical methods, including hypothesis tests from scipy, were utilized to formulate and validate hypotheses related to customer churn.

-  **Visual Insights**: Using matplotlib and seaborn, insightful graphics were created to answer important questions about customer churn.

-  **PowerBI Deployment**: Power BI was used to distribute analysis and graphics for interactive sharing and exploration.

-  **Data Balancing**:

-  **Model Training and Evaluation**: 

-  **Model Fine-Tuning**: 

-  **Advanced Model Improvement**: 

-  **Future Predictions**:

## Questions and Hypotheses

#### The following analytical questions will help us gain insight and as well as confirm our hypothesis.

- How long Female and Male spent with Telco before churning?
- What is the trend between Contract and churn?
- How long does it take each contract type before churning?
- Which method of payment was prefered among the Senior Citizens and how much in total did both Senior and non Senior citizens pay before churning?
- What is the churn trend for gender and dependents as well as their tenure?
- What is the trend between payment methods and gender and how does it affect churning?
- What is the trend between tenure and paperlessBilling in relation to churn?
- What is the trend between tenure, Internet Service and senior citizen in relation to churn?
- What is the trend between StreamingMovies and senior citizen in relation to churn?
- How does internetService and OnlineSecurity affect churning?
- What is the trend between Contract and Payment Method in relation to churn?

### Hypotheses:
#### A significance level (Î±) of 5% will used to perform all the hypothesis testing
